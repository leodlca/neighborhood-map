# Neighborhood Map Project

### About the project

Link to the demo: [Demo](https://leodlca.github.io/neighborhood-map)

This project is basically a website that combines Knockout.js MVVM Library, Google Maps API and Wikipedia
API to display my favorite tourist spots of Vancouver, the city where I've been last year (2017). My goal
was to make a fast and fully responsive website.
