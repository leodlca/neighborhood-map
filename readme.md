# Neighborhood Map Project

This project is basically a website that combines Knockout.js MVVM Library, Google Maps API and Wikipedia
API to display my favorite tourist spots of Vancouver, the city where I've been last year (2017). My goal
was to make a fast and fully responsive website.

### How to Install/Run the Project

**NOTE**: You can also check out the app by simply clicking on this [link.](https://leodlca.github.io/neighborhood-map)

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file, or clone it. ¹
2. Navigate to the repository folder on Terminal/DOS.
3. Run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" or "python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000". ²
4. Load the page at localhost:8000.

**¹** If you don't want to run it in a local server, simply follow step one and open the index.html file at the repository folder.

**²** You must have python installed in your machine in order to run these commands. Note that python is already installed by default on Unix-based systems such as Linux and Mac OS X.
